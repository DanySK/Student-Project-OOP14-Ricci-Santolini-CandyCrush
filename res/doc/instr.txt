This game is very easy! 
If you want to win a match you just have to reach the score you see on the 
screen before your moves drop to 0!
If you play in EASY mode you'll have no problems but if you choose the
DIFFICULT mode it will be very hard!
To make points and win the game you just have to exchange CANDIES on 
the screen  to make combinations of 3, 4 or 5 CANDIES of the same COLOR.
To make an exchange you just have to click on a CANDY and click again on 
another CANDY next to her. 
You can't exchange two candies if they're not side by side and you can't make 
diagonal moves.
When you make a move you must form at least a combination of 3 CANDIES of 
the same color or they will come back in their previous position!
If you make a combination of 3 CANDIES of the same color they will disappear 
and give you points!
A combination of 4 CANDIES will make a STRIPED CANDY that could destroy 
an entire row or column.
A combination of 2 tris will make a WRAPPED CANDY that could destroy 
all the other candies  around her.
A combination of 5 CANDIES will make a SPECIAL CANDY...
she has a big surprise for you!
When your points are more than the required score YOU WIN!!
If your moves drop to 0 and you haven't enough points, YOU LOSE!
Now you know everything's necessary to enjoy the game!
Let's go!
